Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome to N4 Flight software docs. N4 Flight software is the code used to run N4 rockets at Nakuja Rocket Project. This code is built using FreeRTOS on the Arduino-ESP32 framework. It is designed to run either on AI-Thinker NodeMCU-ESP32 boards or ESP32-DOIT-DEVKIT V1.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="step1"></a>
Major features</h1>
<p>This firmare has been improved tremendously from the previous versions and includes the following features:</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="step2"></a>
Modularity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most of the code is now contained in separate files each perfoming its own singular task to ensure code maintainability and testing.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="step3"></a>
System Logging</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have built a system logger to keep track of each and every operation that the flight computer undertakes. This can be be retrieved later and reviewed for post-flight analysis</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="step4"></a>
HIL Testing Engine</h2>
<ul>
<li>A hardware-in-the-loop testing engine has been built into the flight software to allow us to "Test Like We Fly". This allows the flight computer to be tested and debugged way before flight day. Using an improvised XMODEM algorithm, we are able to upload test flight data and run necessary integration tests. <dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>See Integration and Testing Procedures for more info</dd></dl>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="step5"></a>
Flight data logging</h2>
<ul>
<li>Flight data logging has been improved. Using an onboard SPI Flash memory, we are able log sensor data and flight states.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="step6"></a>
Data dump interface</h2>
<ul>
<li>A data dumping hardware interface has been added to ease the retrieval of data post flight data.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="step7"></a>
SAFE and FLIGHT modes</h2>
<ul>
<li>To prevent misfires during intergration and testing, this firmware implements SAFE_MODE that among others operations, disables the pyro-charges before POWERED_FLIGHT.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="step8"></a>
XBEE, MQTT, LORA, WIFI telemetry selection</h2>
<ul>
<li>For backward and forward compatibility, we implement a method to allow choice of data telemetry protocol being used.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="step9"></a>
Double ejection</h2>
<ul>
<li>We implement drogue and main chute ejection algorithms for successful vehicle recovery</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_sec"></a>

</div><!-- fragment --></li>
<li>Connect your flight computer using a USB cable and make sure it is seen by your PC. It should be listed under Device Manager&gt;Ports, if you are on windows</li>
</ul>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>If your ESP32 is note recognized, you have to install USB-TO-TTL chip driver manually. For ESP32 Boards using CH340 chip, download the driver here <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers/all">CH340 Driver-SparkFun</a>. Run the driver and it will be automatically installed on your machine. For ESP32 Boards using CP2102 chip, follow the procedure here <a href="https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J7/all">CP2102-driver-POLOLU</a>. Run the driver and it will be automatically installed on your machine.</dd></dl>
<p>Upload and run Close any open serial ports connected to that ESP32 and run the command below </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">pio run -t upload </div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> The firmware will be uploaded to the flight computer!</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="step13"></a>
Hardware, pin assignment and peripherals</h1>
<p> 
    <div >

        <img src="n4-flight-computer-pinout-link.png" >

    </div>
 </p>
<p>The pin assignment to ESP32 are listed in the following file: <a href="https://github.com/nakujaproject/N4-Flight-Software/blob/main/flight-computer-pin-assignment-version-1.xlsx">https://github.com/nakujaproject/N4-Flight-Software/blob/main/flight-computer-pin-assignment-version-1.xlsx</a></p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="step20"></a>
Pre-flight software checks</h1>
<p>The following checks MUST be performed pre-flight to ensure the software operates as designed:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>TEST/RUN mode pin toggle</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The flight computer MUST be in the RUN mode during launch. RUN mode is set by setting the toggle pin on the side labelled as RUN</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Telemetry protocol selection (MQTT or XBEE)</b></li>
</ul>
<p>If using MQTT with WIFI, ensure that the #define MQTT in <a class="el" href="defs_8h.html" title="necessary miscellaneous defines for various tasks and functions">defs.h</a> is set to 1. If using XBEE, ensure that the #define #define XBEE in <a class="el" href="defs_8h.html" title="necessary miscellaneous defines for various tasks and functions">defs.h</a> is set to 1. If using both, enure both are set to 1.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ClientID (rocket ID)</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, every rocket is named before launch. So change the rocket_ID variable in main.cpp before uploading the code to a specific flight computer. This naming will help with the log files to know which data belongs to which computer.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Arming check</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In SAFE MODE, The green LED on the flight computer should be blinking, the red LED should be OFF. In ARMED MODE, the red LED should be blinking, the green LED should be OFF. Do not connect the pyro-technic charges while the flight computer is in ARMED MODE. Arming is done only from the base station, away from the rocket to prevent any misfires.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>DEBUG_TO_TERMINAL check</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Debug via the serial monitor should be enabled only on ground during development and testing. During flight, debugging to terminal should be disabled. To disable debugging, set the DEBUG and DEBUG_TO_TERMINAL constants in <a class="el" href="defs_8h.html" title="necessary miscellaneous defines for various tasks and functions">defs.h</a> to 0.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>LOG_TO_MEMORY check</b></li>
</ul>
<p>During development, it is discovered that logging to memory every time is a waste of memory resources, which are scarce. Log to memory only when needed. Set the LOG_TO_MEMORY constant in <a class="el" href="defs_8h.html" title="necessary miscellaneous defines for various tasks and functions">defs.h</a> to 0 to disable logging to memory and set to 1 to enable. This variable MUST be set to 1 during flight, otherwise there will be no data collected.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="step21"></a>
WIFI network configuration</h1>
<p>The software is written such that it allows connection to any WIFI being used, without hardcoding the WIFI credentials into the flight software. This will make the launch preparation faster as no code uploading needs to be done on-site. Follow the procedure below to connect to WIFI:</p><ul>
<li>After uploading the flight software to the computer, the serial terminal will show the following response. Note the marked are which is of interest.</li>
</ul>
<p> 
    <div style="text-align: center;">

        <img src="step-1-serial.png" >

    </div>
  This shows that the flight computer has created a web portal and is waiting for connection from an external device.</p>
<ul>
<li>When powered on, the flight computer will create an open WIFI network called "flight-computer-1". This network will be visible on any device within range.</li>
<li>The FC sets itself as an Access Point and will provide its own WIFI network to the for other devices to connect to.</li>
<li>On the ground station computer, or using a smartphone, connect to "flight-computer-1". (NOTE: The WIFI name will change depending on the name of the rocket being used )</li>
<li>Open the browser and go to the following IP address "192.168.4.1". This should open the following window in your browser.</li>
</ul>
<p> 
    <div style="text-align: center;" height=400 width=200>

        <img src="step-1-res.jpg" >

    </div>
 </p><ul>
<li><p class="startli">Click on Configure WiFi. The window below opens.  
    <div style="text-align: center;">

        <img src="step-2.jpg" >

    </div>
 </p><ul>
<li>Enter the WIFI SSID and password for the network you want to connect to. In this case it is the WIFI network used for telemetry transmission.</li>
<li>Press save. The flight computer will save the network credentials and auto-reconnect itself as a station to the launch WIFI network.  
    <div style="text-align: center;">

        <img src="step-3.jpg" >

    </div>
 </li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">– Assuming that the you have supplied the correct login credentials, the ESP32 will now be connected to the WiFi network.</p><ul>
<li>You can now stream telemetry over that network.</li>
<li>Make sure that the ground station PC and the flight computer are on the same network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

MQTT configuration</h1>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>In Development</dd></dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="step23"></a>
Flight Data Collection and Kalman Filtering</h1>
<p>The main senors used in the flight computer are accelerometer and pressure sensors. We use the <a class="el" href="class_m_p_u6050.html">MPU6050</a> for acceleration and angular velocity measurements. We use the BMP180 for atmospheric pressure and altitude measurement. This data is collected as raw data which is then processed and filtered using the Kalman filter algorithm.</p>
<p>The <em><b>Kalman Filter</b></em> allows us to perform predictive recursive low pass filtering which greatly improves our collected sensor data which is safe for the state machine to consume.</p>
<p>To learn more about the Kalman filter implementation, refer to the kalman.h and kalman.cpp files in the src folder of the n4-flight-software.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="step24"></a>
Launch detection</h1>
<p>Launch is detected using the altimeter data. There is a set threshold above which a rocket is considered to be launched. This variable is in the LAUNCH_DETECTION_THRESHOLD in <a class="el" href="defs_8h.html" title="necessary miscellaneous defines for various tasks and functions">defs.h</a>. If the onboard altimeter registers that the current relative altitude is above this threshold, then the rocket is considered as launched.</p>
<p>If the flight computer is not armed when launch is detected, it is automatically armed to override the arming command from base station.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="step25"></a>
Apogee detection</h1>
<p>We detect apogee using relative altitude values from the altimeter. The logic we use is that the * rocket's altitude increases as it ascends up continuously. On reaching apogee, the rocket's altitude *starts decreasing.</p>
<p>To detect the decrease in altitude, we keep track of the last SIZE_OF_BUFFER items (see *ring_buffer.h). We then check the current altitude value against the oldest value in the ring *buffer. If the difference is more than the set THRESHOLD (usually 5 meters), we are sure that at *this point the rocket is coming down and we register APOGEE.</p>
<p>This is made possible using a ring buffer(circular buffer), that is implemented to always keep track of the previous SIZE_OF_BUFFER. From this buffer we can infer apogee.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="step26"></a>
Parachute ejection</h1>
<p>This version of the flight software implements double ejection mechanism. ... [TODO]</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="step27"></a>
Flight data logging and data recovery</h1>
<p>Flight data is logged in the external SPI flash memory. The file used is called <em>flight.txt</em>. The contents of the flight.txt are erased during setup of the fight computer. Logging starts after the flight computer has been armed, to prevent logging unnecesary pre-flight data.</p>
<p>First make sure you have the following serial tool downloaded:</p>
<p> 
    <a href="https://docs.ai-thinker.com/en/%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E5%B7%A5">Ai Thinker Serial port debugging assistant</a>
    </p>
<p>To recover the file, follow the procedure below to get the data dumped from the flight computer.</p>
<ul>
<li>After the rocket has landed, disconnect the computer from the battery in the avionics bay.</li>
<li>Assuming the onboard ESP32 is not damaged, connect via USB cable and upload the code in  <i>\flight-data-recovery\n4-data-recovery-code</i>  folder, using the command below:</li>
</ul>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">pio run -t upload</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><ul>
<li>After the code has uploaded, open the Ai-THINKER serial monitor tool downloaded above.</li>
<li>Press RESET (EN) on the onboad ESP32. The following window should open:</li>
</ul>
<p> 
        <div style="text-align: center;">

            <img src="show-menu.png" >

        </div>
    </p>
<p>This file shows the options you are provided with after running the software. The options are described below:</p><ul>
<li>List files - List all the files saved in the flash memory</li>
<li>Dump data - dump all the data in the <b>flight.txt</b> file.</li>
<li>To select an option, enter the letter shown on the option and press SEND. The corresponding action will occur. For example <b>l</b> to select <b>List all files</b></li>
<li>To dump the data, enter <em><b>d</b></em> and press send. You should see the data being printed on the console as csv strings. The image below shows this step:</li>
</ul>
<p> 
        <div style="text-align: center;">

            <img src="dump-window.png" >

        </div>
    </p><ul>
<li>Wait for the data dump operation to complete. After complete, press the <em><b>Save rec</b></em> file shown below and save the file as <em><b>.txt</b></em></li>
</ul>
<p> 
        <div style="text-align: center;">

            <img src="save-rec.jpg" >

        </div>
    </p>
<p>You should have your flight file recovered successfully.</p>
<p>If the onboard ESP32 has been damaged, use these steps:</p><ul>
<li>Locate the data dump interface on the flight computer PCB.</li>
<li><p class="startli">Connect header pins to an external NODEMCU ESP32 to the data dump using the following connection diagram.</p>
<table class="doxtable">

Avionics Integration and Power-Up procedure</h1>
<p>This section describes how the avionics is integrated into the rocket and how it is powered up.</p>
<p><em><b>Integration procedure</b></em> </p><dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>In development</dd></dl>
<p><em><b>Power Up procedure</b></em></p>
<p>Once the flight computer is inserted into the body tube, the RBF pin must be inserted into the pre-allocated RBF hole on the body tube.</p>
<p>These next steps describe the sequence of events and observations made after the RBF pin is removed.</p><ul>
<li>Pull out the RBF pin</li>
<li>The flight computer beeps once and goes through its boot-up sequence. If debugging this via the serial terminal, you should see a bunch of messages showing messages from the flight computer. If not seeing any messages, ensure the DEBUGGING and DEBUG_TO_TERMINAL in <a class="el" href="defs_8h.html" title="necessary miscellaneous defines for various tasks and functions">defs.h</a> are set to 1.</li>
<li>The green LED lights up and starts blinking to indicate the flight computer is in SAFE MODE.</li>
<li>The flight computer creates an access point to allow for WIFI configuration. (see WIFI configuration section to see how to connect the flight computer to the network)</li>
<li>Once the WIFI is connected successfully, the base station should start receiving the telemetry packet from the flight computer.</li>
<li>If a telemetry packet is received from the base station, then the flight computer avionics is a GO!</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="step31"></a>
Testing Procedures</h1>
<p>To perform testing and integration of the flight computer, follow the steps below:</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="step15"></a>
